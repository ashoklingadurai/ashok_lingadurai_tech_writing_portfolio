## Project Case Studies
**Context:** *Case studies are a brief documentation that gives you an overview of a client's project, its challenges faced by the developers, how they overcame it and what solutions/technologoes the team used to solve the challenge. These documents are ideally used as marketing collaterals.*

The following site hosts all the case study documents which I've worked on over the period of 1.5 years. These documents cover the different software/product solutions implemented across different client verticals *(Healthcare, Retail, ERP, Aerospace, etc)* - [View Case Studies](https://inapp.com/resources/case-studies/)
